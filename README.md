# Introduction

## **What is `npm`?**

* NPM stands for Node Package Manager.
* It is a package manager for JavaScript.
* NPM helps manage packages (modules) of reusable code in JavaScript.
* Packages are directories with modules and a "package.json" file containing metadata.
* The term "package" is sometimes used interchangeably with "module."

## How NPM Manages Packages:

* Developers write code to solve specific problems.
* NPM allows developers to publish their code to the NPM registry.
* Other developers can reuse and depend on published code.
* NPM facilitates updates to code, making it easy for dependent developers to check for and download updates.
* NPM helps share and manage code, ensuring different versions are easily accessible.

**Let's take an example for better understanding...**

Imagine you're "developer A," and you've created some fantastic JavaScript code. NPM lets you put your code in a special place called the "NPM registry." This is like sharing your code with other developers.

Now, let's say you, "developer A," make improvements to your code. NPM makes it easy for other developers who use your code to know about these updates and get the latest and greatest version of your superhero code.

In a nutshell, NPM is like a friendly helper that makes it simple to save, share, and update your code, so you and other developers can build cool stuff faster.
